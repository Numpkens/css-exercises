xxxxxThere is space between all items and the edge of the header (specific px amount doesn't matter here).
xxxxxLogo is centered vertically and horizontally.
- list-items are horizontal, and are centered vertically inside the header.
- left-links and right-links are pushed all the way to the left and right, and stay at the edge of the header when the page is resized.
- Your solution does not use floats, inline-block, or absolute positioning.*/
